I am a post-doctoral researcher at Yonsei University, where I also earned my Ph.D. in EE/CS as a member of the [intelligent networking lab. (INL)](https://cbchae.org). I also served as visiting post-doctoral researcher at HKUST in [iComAI Lab](https://eejzhang.people.ust.hk/). My research focuses on intelligent, machine learning-driven systems and low-complexity signal processing for next-generation wireless networks, covering both protocol design and physical-layer techniques.


My interests span radio resource management (RRM), PHY/MAC/RRC protocols, and emerging technologies such as full-duplex (FD) and future multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. I solve practical communication problems through mathematical optimization, algorithmic modeling, and AI, and validate the solutions through proof-of-concept (PoC) prototypes and system-level simulations (SLS).

I received **1st prize** in the [*IEEE ComSoc 4M Thesis Competition*](https://www.comsoc.org/education-training/ieee-comsoc-four-minute-thesis-4mt-competition/winners), am a **5-time winner** of the [*Samsung Humantech Paper Award*](https://humantech.samsung.com/saitext/index.jsp), and have presented prototyping work at IEEE GLOBECOM 3 times. I hold 5 patents (including a U.S. patent) and have published in 6 top-tier journals, with one paper ranked in the top 0.4% of JCR.
